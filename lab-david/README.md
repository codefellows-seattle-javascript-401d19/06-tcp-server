## TCP Chat Server
This little project spins up a TCP chat so you can chat all day long from the friendly confines of your computer. 

## Motivation
I was motivated by an extreme desire to learn web development which led me to enroll in this program which ultimately led me to this assignment.

## Tech/framework used
Node.JS, Javascript, ESLint, Jest, Faker, Winston

## Features
Mine fails in the most epic manner.. 

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Clone or fork this repo to your local machine then install the npm dependencies faker and winston. 

## Tests
There are no tests right now.

## How to use?
Once you install the dependencies you should be able to run `node index.js` to start your server. It will be running on port 3000. To access the chat use Telnet. To get into telnet enter `telnet 127.0.0.1 3000` which is telnet, your computer's default IP address and the port number of 3000. 

## Functions In The Chat
- `@quit` : disconnects the client from the chat
- `@list` : lists out all the current users in the chat
- `@nickname` : enter a new nickname to be known by in the chat
- `@dm` : you can send a direct message to another user in the chat. *currently broken*
